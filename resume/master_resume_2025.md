# Experience
## **Data Labeler for Software** (part time) | 2024 - Present
Aided in the finetuning of proprietary language models by creating and labeling highly diverse synthetic coding datasets.

Designed project scenarios ranging from fundamental web development and data analysis to niche domains, including
**compiler development** and **graphics programming**, significantly broadening model coverage.

## **Embedded Engineer at Stealth Startup** | 2024 - 2025
Lead R&D efforts and developed contract procurement portfolio

 - Created demo **Linux Drivers** for off the shelf sensors
 - Prototyped and built **real-time embedded applications** using
   the **Zephyr OS**
 - Developed a custom in-house **embedded linux** distribution using
   the **Yocto Project**
 - Contributed to the initial R&D and feasibility analysis
   for a next-generation real-time sensor fusion platform

## **Red Hat Internship** | Summer 2020
Contributed to the modernization of the **Ceph dashboard API**, focusing on improving API design, performance, and scalability standards.

## **Draper Internship** | 2018 - 2019
Engineered and implemented **complex internal diagnostic tooling** for a custom platform as part of a rigorous **FAA Compliance CRS contract**.
* Integrated tooling with **VxWorks** and **offline data collection** systems to facilitate rigorous testing and quality assurance protocols.

# Projects
## **Amp Simulator VST Plugin** | 2023
Repositories: [Codom/CLAP Tutorial](https://github.com/Codom/clap-tutorial) & [Codom/SimpleGuitarAmp](https://github.com/Codom/SimpleGuitarAmp)

Created an Amp Simulator VST plugin using the CLAP API, loadable in DAWs like Bitwig.

* Implemented a Biquad Transfer Function to accurately simulate the complex filters found in a typical Fender pre-amp.
* Features functional parameter knobs and digital distortion simulation.
* Abstracted c ABI into a more ergonomic trait system

## **liballoc (C Library)** | 2022
Repository: [Codom/liballoc](https://github.com/Codom/liballoc)

Designed and implemented a custom, robust **allocator interface** in a **single C header file**, loosely based on Zig’s allocator interface.

* Allows for **trivial dependency injection** of memory management behavior.
* Provides implementations for libc, a **custom arena allocator**, and a fixed linear allocator.
* Optionally integrates with **ASAN (AddressSanitizer)** by utilizing memory poisoning functions for superior debugging of use-after-free bugs.

## **Godot KanBan Board** | 2021
Built a multi-project KanBan board utilizing the Godot scene system.

* Implemented serialization to disk via JSON for persistent project state management.

## **Vulkan Tutorial Implementation** | 2021
Repository: [Codom/Vulkan-Tutorial](https://github.com/Codom/Vulkan-Tutorial)

Completed a C++ implementation of the official Vulkan-Tutorial to master modern graphics API concepts.

* Developed a high-level C++ wrapper around verbose Vulkan functions to manage render primitives and render passes more efficiently.

# Education
## **University of Massachusetts, Lowell** | 2017 - 2021
Coursework focused on Operating Systems, Compilers, Distributed Computing, and Cybersecurity.

* Key Member of the NeCCDC competitive team.
* Served as a lab technician for ECG (Engaging Computing Group).
* Contributed to the launch of a Red Hat embedded systems outreach course.

## **Framingham State University** | 2016 - 2017
* Introductory coursework in Computer Science
